> **Production-ready personal film people tracker** with TMDb integration, advanced search, and professional mobile-first design for Letterboxd enthusiasts

## 🎯 Why MyFilmPeople?

**Ever wished you could easily follow your favorite directors, actors, and crew members across different films?** 

While Letterboxd excels at tracking films, it lacks a dedicated way to manage and organize the **people** behind the movies you love. MyFilmPeople fills that gap by giving you a personal database to:

### 🌟 **What This App Does**
- � **Follow Cast & Crew**: Create your personal "following" list of directors, actors, writers, cinematographers, and other crew members (like following artists on music platforms)
- 🔗 **Quick Profile Access**: Instantly jump to any person's Letterboxd profile to browse their filmography
- 📝 **Remember Why They Matter**: Add personal notes about what makes each person special to you
- 🎬 **Discover New Work**: Easily check your followed people's latest projects and add them to your watchlist
- 📱 **Stop Manual Searching**: No more digging through cast lists - your favorite people are always one tap away
- 🎯 **Streamline Your Workflow**: Follow → Browse → Discover → Add to Watchlist, all in seconds

### 💡 **Why We Created This**
Letterboxd is perfect for film discovery and you can follow other users, but there's a crucial gap: **you can't follow the actual filmmakers themselves** - the directors, actors, writers, cinematographers, and crew members whose work you love.

This means when you discover a brilliant cinematographer or fall in love with a new actor's performance, you have no way to "follow" them like you would follow an artist on other platforms. You end up:
- 🔍 **Manually searching** cast and crew lists over and over
- 😔 **Missing new releases** from your favorite people  
- 🤔 **Forgetting names** of talented crew members you wanted to track
- ⏰ **Wasting time** searching through your watched films to remember who directed that amazing movie

**MyFilmPeople solves this by giving you a personal "following" system for cast and crew.** Instead of manually searching back and forth, you follow the people you want to track, then easily access their profiles and filmographies to discover new movies for your watchlist.

**Track your favorite directors, actors, and crew members with a beautiful, professional interface inspired by Letterboxd's design.**
