# MyFilmPeople

> **Follow your favorite filmmakers like following artists on music platforms** - A production-ready personal tracker for directors, actors, and crew members with seamless Letterboxd integration and Letterboxd-inspired design.

## What This App Does for Film Enthusiasts

**Ever wished you could easily follow your favorite directors, actors, and crew members across different films?** 

While Letterboxd excels at film tracking, it lacks a dedicated way to manage and organize the **people** behind the movies you love. MyFilmPeople fills that gap with a personal "following" system for filmmakers.

### **Core User Experience**
- **Track People You Love**: Build a personal "following" list of filmmakers whose work you want to follow
- **Jump to Letterboxd Instantly**: One-click access to any person's Letterboxd filmography 
- **Remember Why They Matter**: Add personal notes about what makes each person special
- **Discover New Work**: Easily browse your followed people's latest projects
- **Mobile-First Design**: Perfect for movie theater lobby browsing and couch discoveries
- **Works Instantly**: No waiting, loads immediately and works offline after first visit

### **Why This Exists**
You can follow users on Letterboxd, but **you can't follow the actual filmmakers** - the directors, actors, writers, cinematographers whose work you love. This means:

- **Endless manual searching** through cast lists
- **Missing new releases** from favorite people  
- **Forgetting brilliant crew members** you wanted to track
- **Time wasted** searching your watched films to remember directors

**MyFilmPeople solves this** by giving you a personal "following" system for cast and crew, streamlining your film discovery workflow.
