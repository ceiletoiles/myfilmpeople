## üéØ Recommended Deployment Strategy

### Week 1: GitHub Pages Prototype
```
1. Push current code to GitHub
2. Enable Pages (free .github.io domain)
3. Share with friends for feedback
4. Add Google Analytics (optional)
```

### Week 2-3: Enhanced Version
```
1. Add localStorage functionality
2. Deploy updated version (auto-updates on GitHub Pages)
3. Test with real usage data
```

### Month 1+: Full Production
```
1. Add backend (Supabase recommended)
2. Custom domain: myfilmpeople.com (~$12/year)
3. Consider: buymeacoffee.com for tips if popular
```

## üåê Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### Buy Domain:
- **Namecheap**: ~$12/year for `.com`
- **Google Domains**: ~$12/year
- **Cloudflare**: ~$10/year (+ free CDN)

### Connect to Your Site:

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### Free Options:
- **Google Analytics**: User behavior, popular features
- **Plausible.io**: Privacy-friendly, simple stats

## üö® Important Notes

### Current Prototype Limitations:
- Data only saves in browser (localStorage)
- No user accounts
- Can't sync across devices
- Data lost if browser storage cleared

### Security Considerations:
- No sensitive data handling needed (current version)
- HTTPS automatically provided by all platforms
- No API keys exposed in frontend code

### Performance:
- Current size: ~3 files, <100KB total
- Loads instantly on any connection
- No database queries = super fast

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Create GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Create new repository**: `myfilmpeople`
3. **Upload your 3 files** via GitHub web interface
4. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Enable**
5. **Share your link**: `https://yourusername.github.io/myfilmpeople`

**Result**: Your prototype is live and accessible worldwide!

## üîÆ Future Scaling Options

### If It Gets Popular:
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (free speed boost)
- **Backend**: Scale to paid tiers
- **Mobile App**: PWA or React Native
- **API**: Build public API for other developers

### Monetization Ideas (if desired):
- Premium features (extra storage, themes)
- TMDb Pro API features
- Letterboxd Pro integration
- Buy Me a Coffee donations

The beauty of starting with static files is you can deploy NOW and scale later without changing your core architecture!
